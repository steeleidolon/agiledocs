This project is a personal project management study guide for Scrum Master and Six Sigma certification training, with the potential for more in the future.

As I progress through training and self-teaching materials, I gather additional references and document my progress and findings.  This helps me to retain and apply the information.

Your mileage may vary, but if you find the information useful, fantastic!
